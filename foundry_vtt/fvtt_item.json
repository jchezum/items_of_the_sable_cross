The appearance of the wings varies from individual to another, shifting in colour to mirror their soul.</p>\n<p>This item has 6 charges and recharges fully at dawn. While attuned to the wings, you have a flying speed equal to 10 multiplied by the number of remaining charges in feet. As a bonus action, you can speak the command word to make the wings appear or disappear.</p>\n <p><strong><em>Razor Sharp.</em></strong> As an action while the wings are present, you can expend 1 charge to hurl a flurry of razor-sharp feathers in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 8d6]] slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
