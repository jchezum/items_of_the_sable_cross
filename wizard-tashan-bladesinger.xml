			<p>Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. 
            Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.  
            In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. 
            Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade. </p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).</p>
			<p>While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
				<li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks .</li>
				<li>You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +l).</li>
			</ul>
            <!-- TODO: Make this equal to proficiency -->
