        "value": "<p>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Legend tells of a young inventor whose greatest passion was to reach the hallowed, gear-filled halls of the Clockwork Nirvana. His work creating a trans-planar shuttle was fraught with danger, leading him to seek help from the tech-priests of Daedalus. In return for a promise of half of the spoils of his exploration, they granted him this blessed ring. Unfortunately his first foray to the outer planes dropped him immediately adjacent to the Clockwork Nirvana's radiant power core and he was never seen again.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vow.</em></strong> While you wear this ring you have a +1 bonus to all saving throws. When you break your word or lie, the bonus to saving throws is suspended until the next dawn and the ring flares brightly, dealing [[/r 1d6]] fire damage to you as it gains a new crack. If you roll a 6 on this fire damage, the ring shatters completely and is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sunkiss.</em></strong> As an action you can cause the ring to detonate. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 10d6]] fire damage and [[/r 10d6]] radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You automatically fail this saving throw. After you use this property the ring is destroyed.</p>",
