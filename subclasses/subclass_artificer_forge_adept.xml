            <p>A FORGE_ADEPT learns how to harness magical, radiant energy and put it to use in their weaponry. These artificers create complex machines that channel and focus light, turning that energy into powerful beams that can sear their foes. These machines come in multiple varieties, each with a distinct purpose and common name. The aurum blaster is the generalist weapon, and also the most defensive weapon, considering its common pairing with a shield. The bolt shooter is a long range weapon, capable of outranging longbows and taking out targets with powerful, focused blasts. The lux cannon is a short ranged weapon, capable of hitting multiple foes at once.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though FORGE_ADEPTs were relatively uncommon in the time of the Last War, those that did exist made versatile combatants that were an asset to any army. Capable both as front-line soldiers and back-line artillery, these artificers are well respected warriors.</p>

                    At 3rd level, you learn to imbue a weapon with a fraction of your spirit. The Dhakaani daashors called this weapon the ghaal’shaarat, Goblin for “mighty blade.” 
                    Imbuing your ghaal’shaarat works like infusing an item, but does not count toward your maximum number of infused items. 
                    When you finish a long rest, you can touch a magic or nonmagical simple or martial melee weapon, which becomes your ghaal’shaarat.

                    Once imbued, your ghaal’shaarat is a magic weapon that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless the base weapon you imbued already grants a higher bonus. 
                    This bonus increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 13th level. 
                    If the weapon you imbued has the thrown property, it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.

                    Your ghaal’shaarat’s benefits remain until the weapon is destroyed or until you use this ability to imbue a new item with this power. 
                    Other creatures can’t benefit from your ghaal’shaarat’s powers, and to them, it functions as the unimbued weapon did.

                    At 9th level, you gain the ability to enhance the weapons of your squad, targeting the damage to the weakness of your enemies. 
                    As an action, you can activate an aura that extends from you in a 30-foot radius. 
                    The aura moves with you, centered on you, and lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were casting a spell).

                    When you activate this aura, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. 
                    Each creature of your choice in the aura deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits with a weapon attack.

                    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.

                    At 15th level, you learn how to imbue your ghaal’shaarat with additional power, and how to draw on it in time of need. 
                    The first time you attack with your ghaal’shaarat on your turn, you can transfer some or all of its bonus to your armor class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. 
                    For every 1 you reduce your attack and damage rolls by, you gain +1 to your AC. As long as you continue holding your ghaal’shaarat, the AC bonus remains in effect until the start of your next turn.  

                    Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can select one of the following benefits. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain the selected benefit whenever you’re holding your ghaal’shaarat.
