        <description>
            <p>The realm of the Feywild abounds with beauty, unpredictable emotion, and rampant magic. A barbarian exposed to this realm feels emotions powerfully and magic saturates their body. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, it is a bellowing roar for freedom, an explosion of expression, manifesting in unpredictable ways.</p>

                At 3rd level, your body reacts to the presence of magic. You can cast the detect magic spell without using a spell slot or components. 
                Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You faintly glow a color corresponding to the school of magic you detect (you choose the colors).
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                Starting at 3rd level, magic erupts from you as you rage. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Surge table to determine the magical effect produced.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                If the wild surge requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

            <p><b><i>Duration. </i></b>
                Some surge effects are persistent; they are active for as long as you are raging, and end once your rage ends. 
                You can only have one persistent effect active at a time; if you trigger another wild surge and roll a new persistent effect, the new effect replaces the old one.            
            </p>
            <p><b><i>Unstable Rage. </i></b>
                Whenever you take damage, you trigger a wild surge.  
                <!-- Whenever you take damage, roll a d20.  -->
                <!-- You trigger a wild surge if the result of the roll is equal to or less than half the damage you took.  -->
                Once you trigger a wild surge in this way, you cannot trigger another one until the start of your next turn.
            </p>        
            <p><b><i>Directed Chaos. </i></b>
                When you roll on the Wild Surge table, you can change the result of the d20 roll by up to 1/2 your proficiency bonus (rounded down) in either direction, changing which effect is produced. 
                Once you do, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
