			<p>Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become Invisible for 2d4 minutes. The Duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the Invisibility ends for that creature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>
				This stick of wonderfully golden butter has been adorned with glowing arcane symbols on two sides. 				
			</p>
			<p>
				As a bonus action you can use the butter to grease the bottoms of your feet.
				While your feet are greased in this way your walking speed is doubled for the next movement you make. This does not work on rough terrain.

				If on your turn you do not move up to your full movement or do not move in a straight line, you must make a DC15 Dexterity saving throw. 
				On a successful save you continue your movement as normal. On a failed save you keep sliding in the direction you were originally heading for the duration of your movement.

				If as a result of this you collide with a solid object or creature you take 1d4 damage per 10 feet of movement taken up until the point of collision.
				The stick of butter can be used 3 times in this way before it is used up. If not utilized in this manner the butter acts as regular butter.
