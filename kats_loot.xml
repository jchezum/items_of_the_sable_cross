    <!-- (Wondrous item, unique) Magnificent Snow Globe 
    Requires a command sequence to activate it (sing “Frosty the Snowman”), and the casting time is 1 minute.
    The mansion remains active for up to 12 hours. While the mansion is in use, the snow globe becomes invisible. This item can only be used once every three days. 
    You conjure an extradimensional dwelling that lasts for the duration. The entrance is located where you set the snow globe. The entrance shimmers faintly when open. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter and exit the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. The caster can open or close the portal if they are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
    Beyond the portal is a snowy clearing with a quaint, cozy cottage that is bigger on the inside. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and a bit chilly. A snowman with a tiny snow mustache is there to greet all who enter, wearing a green vest with a pocketwatch, a little black bowler hat, and an umbrella. 
    You can create any floor plan you like in the cottage, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated like a winter cabin. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of near-transparent servants attend to all who enter. They appear to be tiny elves like in the Santa stories, and are completely obedient to your orders (within reason). Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus, the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the snow globe but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the snow globe. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance. -->

    <!-- (Wondrous item, rare, requires attunement) Fang keeper Necklace - from Griffon's Saddlebag
    A fang keeper is a dark silver necklace that can be adorned with up to 4 monstrous fangs. You can add or replace one or more teeth to the chain up to a total of 4, with 1 hour of work, which can be done over a short rest. While wearing the necklace, you gain the following benefits. 
    Bite. Your teeth lengthen and sharpen slightly; your bite becomes a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. Instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you bite a target in this way, you can immediately use your bonus action to clamp down even harder, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage to the target as part of the same attack. 
    Spectral Maw. As a bonus action, you can choose a tooth on the necklace. If the tooth came from a creature that had the Bite action, it summons the spectral maw in front of you of that creature, which is instantaneous. Make a melee spell attack with the spectral maw; the spell attack bonus and damage depends on the challenge rating of the creature the tooth came from. The tooth then rots immediately after the attack, and it can’t be used again to summon the maw. 

    Challenge rating	Spell Attack Bonus	Damage
    1 or lower		+5 to hit		1d10+2 piercing damage
    2-5			+7 to hit		2d10+3 piercing damage
    6-9			+8 to hit		3d10+4 piercing damage
    10 or higher		+9 to hit		4d10 +5 piercing damage

    Once a creature’s tooth has been used to summon a maw, that same creature’s maw can’t be summoned again. If another tooth on the necklace is from a creature whose maw has already been summoned in this way, it immediately rots.  -->

    1d10 + strength +2
    This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
    Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon (cold).
    +2 weapon, On your first hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon (cold).
    Blast Attack (1/day): As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon (cold) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

    <!-- (Magic Weapon, very rare, requires attunement) Twin Moons
    These chakrams return to the wielder after lacerating their target. Equally lethal in both melee and ranged combat. 

    This magic weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it (1d8+dex+2), and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack. On your first hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

    Shifting Light Step. Once per turn, when you use this weapon to make an attack against a creature, you can move up to 10 feet immediately after the attack without spending movement and without triggering opportunity attacks. You cannot move in this way if your speed is 0. 

    Moonbeam Burst. As an action, you can clash the chakrams together to create a burst effect. Each hostile creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or be engulfed in ghostly white flames, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 
    A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.

    <!-- (Magic Armor, very rare, requires attunement) Shield of the Eldritch Maw - Griffon's Saddlebag
    The face of this shield is seemingly made of teeth, with a clear, fang-like line through its center. While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. 
    While holding the shield, whenever a creature makes a melee attack roll against you and misses, you can use your reaction to make a special melee attack with the shield against that target, with an attack bonus of +8. When you do, the shield splits apart to form a toothy maw, which opens wide and bites down on the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage plus 1d6 psychic damage. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll, the target is magically shunted to a special demiplane within the shield. The creature remains in the demiplane until you end the effect (no action required), to a maximum of 1 minute, during which time it takes 1d4 acid damage plus 3d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in the demiplane is devoured. At the end of each of its turns, the shunted creature can make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a success, it escapes the demiplane and reappears in the nearest unoccupied space. Only one creature can be in the demiplane at a time.  -->

    <!-- (Ring, unique, requires attunement) Raven’s Ring of Spell Storing 
    This ring is shaped like a coiled feather and stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. 
    Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
    While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
    If the wearer is a cleric, they can choose to burn all the stored spells in the ring to boost their chance at divine intervention by 1-5%, depending on how many levels worth of spells are stored in the ring at that time.  -->
